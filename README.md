- 👋 Hi, I’m @kevbrac
- 👀 I’m interested in creating fun projects to automate things that currently occupy my time or the time of friends or family.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that looks interesting and where I can challenge myself to learn.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once met Bono while I was walking the streets of Nashville, TN... extremely nice guy.
